### Feedback Request – Calculator App

I am submitting this mini project titled *Calculator App*, which was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have ensured that all given requirements were met:

- A clean and responsive user interface suitable for different devices.
- Buttons included for digits (0–9), `+`, `−`, `×`, `÷`, `C`, and `=`.
- JavaScript handles all arithmetic operations and updates the result on the display.
- The layout uses Bootstrap for easier and structured styling.
- All required files are organized in a single folder (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`).

I hope this project meets the expectations, and I would greatly appreciate any feedback or suggestions to help improve my work.

Thank you very much.
